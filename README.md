* First/quick attempt at a simple + static website for unicorntaxidermy.com, mixed with a desire to dust off/practice web development. 

* Using a touch of React to try it out, though it's not really needed for something like this. It does help make things a touch more efficient though.

* To start, manually deploying to S3/static hosting. Will automate that at some point. 

* Wrapped in a simple express app for dev, so I can use nodemon to see changes more quickly and because the YT videos don't render without going through a server.
